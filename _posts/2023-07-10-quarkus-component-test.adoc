The Quarkus component model is built on top of CDI.
However, writing unit tests for beans without a running CDI container is often a tedious work.
Without the container services up and running, all the work has to be done manually.
First of all, no dependency injection is performed. 
Furthermore, no events are fired and no observers are notified.
Also, interceptors are not applied.
In short, everything needs to be wired together by hand.
But Quarkus can do better, right?
Of course, it can!
Quarkus 3.2 introduced an experimental feature to ease the testing of CDI components and mocking of their dependencies.
It's a lightweight JUnit 5 extension that does not start a full Quarkus application but merely runs the services needed to make the testing a joyful experience.

== A simple example

First of all, add the `quarkus-junit5-component` module dependency to your project.

[role="primary asciidoc-tabs-sync-maven"]
.Maven
****
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5-component</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
****
[role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-sync-gradle"]
.Gradle
****
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
dependencies {
    testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-junit5-component")
}
----
****

Now, imagine that we have a component `Foo` which is an `@ApplicationScoped` CDI bean.

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped
public class Foo {

    @Inject
    Charlie charlie; <1>

    @ConfigProperty(name = "bar") <2>
    boolean bar; 

    public String ping() { <3>
        return bar ? charlie.ping() : "nok";
    }
}
----
<1>	`Foo` depends on `Charlie` which declares a method `ping()`.
<2>	`Foo` depends on the config property `bar`.
<3>  The goal is to test this method which makes use of the `Charlie` dependency and the `bar` config property.

Then, a simple component test looks like this:

[source,java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.test.InjectMock;
import io.quarkus.test.component.TestConfigProperty;
import io.quarkus.test.component.QuarkusComponentTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

@QuarkusComponentTest <1>
@TestConfigProperty(key = "bar", value = "true") <2>
public class FooTest {

    @Inject
    Foo foo; <3>

    @InjectMock
    Charlie charlieMock; <4>

    @Test
    public void testPing() {
        Mockito.when(charlieMock.ping()).thenReturn("OK"); <5>
        assertEquals("OK", foo.ping());
    }
}
----
<1> `@QuarkusComponentTest` registers the `QuarkusComponentTestExtension` that does all the heavy lifting under the hood.
<2> `@TestConfigProperty` is used to set the value of a configuration property for the test.
<3> The test injects the tested component. The types of all fields annotated with `@Inject` are considered the component types under test.
<4> The test also injects a mock of `Charlie`, a dependency for which a `@Singleton` bean is registered automatically. The injected reference is an "unconfigured" Mockito mock.
<5> The Mockito API is used to configure the behavior of the injected mock.

In this particular test, the only "real" component under the test is `org.acme.Foo`.
The `Charlie` dependency is a mock that is created automatically.
And the value of the `bar` configuration property is set with the `@TestConfigProperty` annotation.

== How does it work?

The `QuarkusComponentTestExtension` does several things during the `before all` test phase.
It starts ArC - the CDI container in Quarkus.
It also registers a dedicated configuration object.
The container is then stopped and the config is released during the `after all` test phase.
The fields annotated with `@Inject` and `@InjectMock` are injected after a test instance is created.
Finally, the CDI request context is activated and terminated per each test method.

NOTE: By default, a new test instance is created for each test method. Therefore, a new CDI container is started for each test method. However, if the test class is annotated with `@org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance` and the test instance lifecycle is set to `org.junit.jupiter.api.TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` then the CDI container will be shared across all test method executions of a given test class. 

=== Tested components

By default, the types of all fields annotated with `@Inject` are considered component types.
However, you can also specify additional test components: either with the `@QuarkusComponentTest#value()` or programmatically as the arguments of the <<advanced_features,`QuarkusComponentTestExtension(Class<?>...)`>> constructor. 
Finally, the static nested classes declared on the test class are components too.

TIP: Static nested classed declared on a test class that is annotated with `@QuarkusComponentTest` are excluded from bean discovery when running a regular `@QuarkusTest` in order to prevent unintentional CDI conflicts.

=== Automatic mocking of unsatisfied dependencies

Unlike in regular CDI environments, the test does not fail if a component injects an unsatisfied dependency.
Instead, a mock bean is registered automatically for each combination of required type and qualifiers of an injection point that resolves to an unsatisfied dependency.
The mock bean has the `@Singleton` scope so it’s shared across all injection points with the same required type and qualifiers.
And the injected reference is an unconfigured Mockito mock.
This mock can be injected in the test with `@io.quarkus.test.InjectMock` and configured with the Mockito API.

=== Configuration

A dedicated `SmallRyeConfig` is registered during the `before all` test phase.
It’s possible to set the configuration properties with the `@TestConfigProperty` annotation or programmatically with the `QuarkusComponentTestExtension#configProperty(String, String)` method.
If you need to use the default values for missing config properties, then `@QuarkusComponentTest#useDefaultConfigProperties()` and `QuarkusComponentTestExtension#useDefaultConfigProperties()` might come in useful.

[[advanced_features]]
== Advanced features

It is possible to configure the `QuarkusComponentTestExtension` programatically.
The simple example above could be rewritten like:

[source,java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.test.InjectMock;
import io.quarkus.test.component.QuarkusComponentTestExtension;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

public class FooTest {

    @RegisterExtension <1>
    static final QuarkusComponentTestExtension extension = new QuarkusComponentTestExtension()
            .configProperty("bar","true");

    @Inject
    Foo foo;

    @InjectMock
    Charlie charlieMock;

    @Test
    public void testPing() {
        Mockito.when(charlieMock.ping()).thenReturn("OK");
        assertEquals("OK", foo.ping());
    }
}
----
<1> Annotate a `static` field of type `QuarkusComponentTestExtension` with the `@RegisterExtension` annotation and configure the extension programmatically.

Sometimes you need full control over the bean attributes and maybe even configure the default behavior of a mocked dependency.
In this case, the mock configurator API and the `QuarkusComponentTestExtension#mock()` method is the right choice.

[source,java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.test.InjectMock;
import io.quarkus.test.component.QuarkusComponentTestExtension;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

public class FooTest {

    @RegisterExtension 
    static final QuarkusComponentTestExtension extension = new QuarkusComponentTestExtension()
            .configProperty("bar","true")
            .mock(Charlie.class)
                .scope(Dependent.class) <1>
                .createMockitoMock(mock -> {
                    Mockito.when(mock.pong()).thenReturn("BAR"); <2>
                });

    @Inject
    Foo foo;

    @Test
    public void testPing() {
        assertEquals("BAR", foo.ping());
    }
}
----
<1> The scope of the mocked bean is `@Dependent`.
<2> Configure the default behavior of the mock.

=== Mocking CDI interceptors

NOTE: This feature is only available in Quarkus 3.3+.

If a tested component class declares an interceptor binding then you might need to mock the interception too.
You can define a mock interceptor class as a static nested class of the test class.
This interceptor class is then automatically discovered 

[source, java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.test.component.QuarkusComponentTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@QuarkusComponentTest
public class FooTest {

    @Inject
    Foo foo;

    @Test
    public void testPing() {
        assertEquals("OK", foo.ping());
    }

    @ApplicationScoped
    static class Foo {

       @SimpleBinding <1>
       String ping() {
         return "ok";
       }

    }

    @SimpleBinding
    @Interceptor
    static class SimpleMockInterceptor {  <2>

        @AroundInvoke
        Object aroundInvoke(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
            return context.proceed().toString().toUpperCase();
        }

    }
}
----
<1> `@SimpleBinding` is an interceptor binding.
<2> The interceptor class is automatically considered a tested component and therefore used during the test execution.
